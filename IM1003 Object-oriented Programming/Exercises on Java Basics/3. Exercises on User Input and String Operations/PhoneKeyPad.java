/*
 * Exercise PhoneKeyPad: On your phone keypad, the alphabets are mapped to digits as follows: ABC(2), DEF(3), GHI(4), JKL(5), MNO(6), PQRS(7), TUV(8), WXYZ(9).
 *
 * Write a program called PhoneKeyPad, which prompts user for a String (case insensitive), and converts to a sequence of Keypad digits. Use a nested-if (or switch-case) in this exercise. Modify your program to use an array for table look-up later.
 *
 * Hints: You can use in.next().toLowerCase() to read a string and convert it to lowercase to reduce your cases.
