/*
 * Exercise TestPalindromicWord: A word that reads the same backward as forward is called a palindrome, e.g., "mom", "dad", "racecar", "madam", and "Radar" (case-insensitive). Write a program called TestPalindromicWord, that prompts user for a word and prints ""xxx" is|is not a palindrome".
 *
 * Hints: Read in a word and convert to lowercase via in.next().toLowercase().
 *
 * A phrase that reads the same backward as forward is also called a palindrome, e.g., "Madam, I'm Adam", "A man, a plan, a canal - Panama!" (ignoring punctuation and capitalization). Modify your program (called TestPalindromicPhrase) to test palindromic phrase.
 *
 * Hints: Read in the lowercase phrase via in.nextLine().toLowercase(). Maintain two indexes, forwardIndex and backwardIndex, used to scan the phrase forward and backward.
